# AWS NACL Deny Use Case

## Objective
This use case is specific to AWS, highlighting actuator specifiers and NACL modifiers.

## Scenario
An AWS account owner follows implicit allow in their VPC NACL ruleset and needs to deny ingress connections for a specific CIDR on tcp/80.

Account/region/vpc/subnet specification must be supplied. Direction is inbound and the rule number determines order of evaluation.
