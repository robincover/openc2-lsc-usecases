<h3>Further Description of this Repository</h3>

<p>
This repository is to allow LSC members to contribute usecases in Markdown 
and use github for change approval and version control, should they desire.
The intent is that this is an additonal method for submitting (with OASIS Wiki, 
documents on OASIS LSC site,
and googledocs
also being valid submission methods).
Members are encouraged to submit use cases in any way they feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
The organization is such that each member can contribute in a subdirectory with their company name.
Should the LSC reach consensus on a set of use cases, 
then another directory can be created for the approved usecases.
But the main intent is to let members create and share use cases of particular interest to them.
